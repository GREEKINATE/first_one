Every moment of my life is a great experience.I wouldn't have said this earlier in my life when everything looked 
like a turmoil.This change has come thankfully since I met my Guru Sadhguru at the Isha yoga center.
The practices that he has taught us plus everything he says makes so much sense.If you choose,
every moment in your life can be joyful is what Sadhguru says and this is so true.The moment we choose to be joyful
I realised that nothing really matters anymore and that according to me is the greatest experience one can have.
